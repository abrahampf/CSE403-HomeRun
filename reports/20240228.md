# Weekly Status Report 

Team Report
Last Week Goals:
  Adding more functionality, connecting the game assets to their corresponding scripts/scenes
Since front-end just selected the asset to be used without functionality
Try to get the database to work remotely.
Connecting our current pages so the scenes switch when a user signs in or registers.

## Progress and Issues:
  Front end finished scene prototypes for demo including stadium assets as well as a couple of log in scene options.
Game mechanics figured out how to get the ball to be hit with screen swiping along with ball physics and score keeping. 
Backend was able to send things locally to the database but not remotely. However we do have the scripts written for the connection along with button mechanics for the calls. 


## Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
  Front end will work on polishing up their scenes they made, perhaps look into audio
Game mechanics will look at polishing the mechanics of the game.
Ball physics

Implementation of baseball bat view
Batter mechanics
Backend will focus on the completion of connecting the database to the game in a remote manner. Trying to find a way to host our php file remotely for remote connection, perhaps in server…
	


## Individual Contributions
### Abraham:
#### Last Week Goals:
Finish up writing scripts for the database and then pivot to writing tests for the game or helping Azucena piece components together. 
		
#### Progress and Issues:
Writing scripts for updating database in different game scenarios
Working on rotating database passwords for private backend repo
Backend database testing research

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Finish writing scripts for backend
Add backend testing
Finish working on rotating database passwords for private backend repo

### Azucena:
#### Last Week Goals:
Finish up the C# scripts that will connect everything for our final release. 
		
#### Progress and Issues:
Finished the C# scripts and fixed up the style for the login page
Created another scene, to give the player the options to either play right away or to log in to their account
Also, displaying the player's high score on the game scene


#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Connecting everything, front-end, back-end, and mechanics for our final release and preparing for our final release. Update documentation about the server and the use cases since we had to make some changes.

### Nathan:
Last Week Goals:
Finish up on menu/setting work - 2 days
 More design on the login page
 
#### Progress and Issues:
Was able to set up all the pause game coding and design within our main scene 
And also the get it to work on connecting to the main menu and instructions page 

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Come as group and merge work to main branch (1 day)
Finalize final steps in what we will submit.
Also work on presentation.


### Hinal:
#### Last Week Goals:
-Help with CI testing, make the instructions page.

#### Progress and Issues:
I did help a bit with CI then we were able to get the CI testing going and my group needed more help with making the instruction page so I decided to make that instead. I also got the group together and figured out how exactly our game is going to work and make the content for the instruction page.

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Merge the instruction page with the pause button in nathan’s repo
 Update the living doc according to how we changed to make our game and also update
Update the read me file. 
Merge all our branches this weekend as a group and resolve any merge conflicts we may have.

### Tian:
#### Last Week Goals:
Complete integration with all earlier feature being in the main game
Address the major bugs that are currently in game
Implement / re-design mechanics including bat swing, pitching, ball interaction, etc.
Communicating with the design team on bat swing animations, whether I should take over as mapping input to animation might introduce a learning curve for those not familiar with the input handling code.

#### Progress and Issues:
Integration is still in-progress. The amount of work for the refactoring is more than I initially expected and I likely need a few more days to complete that part.
Implemented some utility classes for later development, mainly to improve the robustness of bat-ball interaction mechanism and score tracking.

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Complete integration with all earlier features being in the main game before the weekend.
Address the major bugs that are currently in game
Refine mechanics related to bat swing, pitching, ball interaction, etc.
Complete bat swing animations.
