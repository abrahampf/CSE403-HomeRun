Also, displaying the player's high score on the game scene

-Front end finished creating the pause screen and connected to the instruction button.
-Figured out with the group how the game will exactly worked at the end to fill out the instruction page.
Implemented some utility classes for later development, mainly to improve the robustness of bat-ball interaction mechanism and score tracking.


## Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Frontend: 
Complete integration with all earlier features being in the main game before the weekend.
Address the major bugs that are currently in game
Refine mechanics related to bat swing, pitching, ball interaction, etc.
Complete bat swing animations.

Backend:
 Finish writing scripts for backend
Add backend testing
Finish working on rotating database passwords for private backend repo
Connecting everything, front-end, back-end, and mechanics for our final release and preparing for our final release. Update documentation about the server and the use cases since we had to make some changes.
Make the instruction page document and update the readme file
Come as group and merge work to main branch (1 day)
Finalize final steps in what we will submit.
Also work on presentation.

### Hinal:
#### Last Week Goals:
-Help with CI testing, make the instructions page.

#### Progress and Issues:
I did help a bit with CI then we were able to get the CI testing going and my group needed more help with making the instruction page so I decided to make that instead. I also got the group together and figured out how exactly our game is going to work and make the content for the instruction page.

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Merge the instruction page with the pause button in nathanâ€™s repo
 Update the living doc according to how we changed to make our game and also update
Update the read me file. 
Merge all our branches this weekend as a group and resolve any merge conflicts we may have.

### Tian:
#### Last Week Goals:
Complete integration with all earlier feature being in the main game
Address the major bugs that are currently in game
Implement / re-design mechanics including bat swing, pitching, ball interaction, etc.
Communicating with the design team on bat swing animations, whether I should take over as mapping input to animation might introduce a learning curve for those not familiar with the input handling code.

#### Progress and Issues:
Integration is still in-progress. The amount of work for the refactoring is more than I initially expected and I likely need a few more days to complete that part.
Implemented some utility classes for later development, mainly to improve the robustness of bat-ball interaction mechanism and score tracking.

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
