- Come as group and merge work to main branch (1 day)
- Finalize final steps in what we will submit.
- Also work on presentation.


## Progress and Issues:

- We have been able to get the user to interact with the gameplay scene with either swiping and clicking on the screen to hit the ball.
- We ran into multiple bugs throughout the week, such as getting swiping to be detected on phones. 
- Another issue we ran into was during our implementation of counting strikes against the player. The game was counting any click on the screen regardless of involvement with the game as a game action which in turn caused the strikes to increase when it shouldn't. We were able to fix this bug.
- We also were able to display this new feature of showing the players score leader board


## Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Working on and submitting individual final assignment
