# Weekly Status Report

## Team Report
### Last Week Goals:
Adding more functionality, connecting the game assets to their corresponding scripts/scenes
Since front-end just selected the asset to be used without functionality
Try to get the database to work remotely.
Connecting our current pages so the scenes switch when a user signs in or registers.

### Progress and Issues:
Front end finished scene prototypes for demo including stadium assets as well as a couple of log in scene options.
Game mechanics figured out how to get the ball to be hit with screen swiping along with ball physics and score keeping. 
Backend was able to send things locally to the database but not remotely. However we do have the scripts written for the connection along with button mechanics for the calls. 


### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Front end will work on polishing up their scenes they made, perhaps look into audio
- Game mechanics will look at polishing the mechanics of the game.
- Ball physics
- Implementation of baseball bat view
- Batter mechanics
- Backend will focus on the completion of connecting the database to the game in a remote manner. Trying to find a way to host our php file remotely for remote connection, perhaps in server…
	


## Individual Contributions
### Abraham:
#### Last Week Goals:
- Keep doing research on how to connect to the database remotely.
- Hopefully connect the database for remote connection. 
		
#### Progress and Issues:
- Azucena was able to connect remote server to database and game.
- I’ve been writing scripts to get information to and from the database.
  - Keeping track of error codes if things go wrong
  - Sending information to game about user
  - Updating user information such as high score
  - etc…
- Mostly troubleshooting when things go wrong.

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Finish up writing scripts for the database and then pivot to writing tests for the game or helping Azucena piece components together. 

### Azucena:
#### Last Week Goals:
- Continue working on connecting the database remotely and connecting the C# script with the front end. Also, adding more unit testing for the backend.
		
#### Progress and Issues:
- We successfully connected the database remotely!!
- We did this using Azure services
- Now I am writing C# scripts to connect the frontend scenes specifically the login page 4 scene to the backend.
- Making sure the input fields (username and password) are being passed into the post-request
- Having the response appear in the scene so users can know what went wrong
- Also if the user was successful in creating or signing in changing the scene to the game scene
- We are running into some issues with Azure servers and databases so we will continue to debug that.


#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Finish up the C# scripts that will connect everything for our final release. 

### Nathan:
#### Last Week Goals:
- Frontend plans on adding some sort sounding system alongside fans next week(2 days)
- I plan on figuring out how to create a menu page in our main gameplay scene that allows the player to quit/pause..etc. 


#### Progress and Issues:
- Progression we have made is that we have been able to merge our work from the backend side to the main. Now I am able to pull the actual full repo so I can start to implement some of the menu stuff.
- Issues might be writing efficient script that can work smoothly with the game
- Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Finish up on menu/setting work - 2 days
- More design on the login page
### Hinal:
#### Last Week Goals:
- Improve the login page and try to implement the sound
#### Progress and Issues:
- I learned about how to inclue sound but I ran onto some issue it wasn’t working properly with the assets attached.
- The back end team needs help with writing CI test, so I have started to look into that.
#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Help with CI test development and figure out how to properly include sound in our assets by the end of next thursday. 
- Help backend team with writing CI test and finish it by next thursday.
### Tian:
#### Last Week Goals:
- Further refine the game mechanics, including debugging, considering a different approach to bat-ball contact and impact, etc.
Include a game mechanic unit test suite with some tests for previous bugs encountered.

#### Progress and Issues:
- Since others figured out the main scene and database connection and pushed it to the main branch, I spent some time working on adjusting project file structures to reduce integration difficulty. I also modified the scene from the front-end design team to improve various potential issues including fixing unnatural camera view, removing unnecessary scale conversion, etc. The rest is me integrating the game mechanics into what is already there. Currently, pitching and batting mechanics have been successfully combined into the main game.
- Attempt to debug earlier code; currently in the process of locating the issue; however, in contrast to usual practice, I will complete the integration first before fixing bugs; because the refactor is relatively intuitive, it should introduce few new bugs.
- Included a unit test suite.
- Working on repo documentation; added an empty user manual and moved the developer manual into the repo, with a superlink from the top page README.md for easier navigation.

#### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Complete integration with all earlier feature being in the main game
- Address the major bugs that are currently in game
- Implement / re-design mechanics including bat swing, pitching, ball interaction, etc.
- Communicating with the design team on bat swing animations, whether I should take over as mapping input to animation might introduce a learning curve for those not familiar with the input handling code.
