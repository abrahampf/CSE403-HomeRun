# Weekly Status Report

## Team Report
### Last Week Goals:
- Adding more functionality, connecting the game assets to their corresponding scripts/scenes
    - Since front-end just selected the asset to be used without functionality
-  to get the database to work remotely.
- Connecting our current pages so the scenes switch when a user signs in or registers.

### Progress and Issues:
- Front end finished scene prototypes for demo including stadium assets as well as a couple of log in scene options.
- Game mechanics figured out how to get the ball to be hit with screen swiping along with ball physics and score keeping. 
- Backend was able to send things locally to the database but not remotely. However we do have the scripts written for the connection along with button mechanics for the calls. 


### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Front end will work on polishing up their scenes they made, perhaps look into audio
- Game mechanics will look at polishing the mechanics of the game.
  - Ball physics
  - Implementation of baseball bat view
  - Batter mechanics
- Backend will focus on the completion of connecting the database to the game in a remote manner. Trying to find a way to host our php file remotely for remote connection, perhaps in server…
	


## Individual Contributions
### Abraham:
### Last Week Goals:
- Finish up the database connection
- Finish up CI connection issues
- Write scripts that’ll send data back and forth from the server and the database. 
		
### Progress and Issues:
- Worked on connecting the database along with Azucena in time for the demo presentation.
- We were able to do this locally but not remotely yet.
- Fixed the CI system implementation on github.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Keep doing research on how to connect to the database remotely.
- Hopefully connect the database for remote connection. 

### Azucena:
Last Week Goals:
- I created a C# script for the server but it was not used in our demo.
		
### Progress and Issues:
- Since I figured that the server I created was not going to be useful I started to help Abraham with how to connect the game with a remote database. We were able to do this locally but not remotely which is an issue we are facing currently.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Continue working on connecting the database remotely and connecting the C# script with the front end. Also, adding more unit testing for the backend.

### Nathan:
Last Week Goals:
- I plan on creating my own branch of our main repo so i can create some version of what we want our scene to look like and what assets we want to be asserted in our game(2 days)
- From then on come together with the front end and decide what parts of our each branches we like to push to the main to so we can create our demo for the Demo presentation(1 day) 

### Progress and Issues:
- The progress made was being able to finish the main gameplay scene our project is going to be set on while also creating multiple login/register page that will be displayed at the start of the game. 
- An issue was getting the ui to fit respectively to each specific screen it will be ran on, that kind of gave me an issue but I was able to fix it for some of the login pages.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Frontend plans on adding some sort sounding system alongside fans next week(2 days)
- I plan on figuring out how to create a menu page in our main gameplay scene that allows the player to quit/pause..etc. 

### Hinal:
### Last Week Goals:
- Set up the assets and login page in unity

### Progress and Issues:
- We were able to set up the 3D assets like stadium, baseball and login page in unity but we need to figure out how to include sound or audience or additional features to make it look more visually appealing and interactive.
### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Next week I plan to add audience, try to find a better stadium and look into  how can I include sound with our assets. 

### Tian:
### Last Week Goals:
- Communicate with Abraham regarding CI setup progress
- Start implementing some core classes that're required by the game including batting logic, etc. Work with the rest of the front-end team to integrate assets and gameplay.

### Progress and Issues:
- Implement basic core game play
  - We now have a main scene with automatic ball pitch and bat functionality available by swiping the screen. Although playable, some mapping between swiping inputs and batting does not appear to be working properly. I need to look into the problem.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Further refine the game mechanics, including debugging, considering a different approach to bat-ball contact and impact, etc.
- Include a game mechanic unit test suite with some tests for previous bugs encountered.
