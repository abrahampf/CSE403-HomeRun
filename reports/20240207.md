# Weekly Status Report

## Team Report

### Last Week Goals:
Do individual/group research on sepeerated by frontend/backendand part of our project and learning into how each of our components works to get started on implementation. 

### Progress and Issues:
- Each team member researched various CI frameworks before deciding on GameCI via Github Actions. We currently have a CI suite set up, but the Unity project setup for the repo has yet to meet the standard Unity project requirements set by GameCI due to a variety of issues, including licensing.
- We discussed the game's design as a team and are now working on a 3D game instead of a 2D one. This is due to a number of factors, including labor constraints when creating animations, game play logic, and a poor representation of making a baseball game in 2D.
- We discussed each member's current role in contributing to the project, with Hinal and Nate working on game scene and asset acquisition and design, Tian working on core game mechanics, and Azu and Abraham working on the game account system database/server. We also established standard procedures for project version control and contribution.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
#### Begin implementation:
- We plan to begin game implementation as soon as possible, where the work is being distributed as mentioned above.

- Resolve the remaining issues with our CI testing suite to ensure its functionality (actual tests are not required to be made yet).

- Further communication regarding project presentation for beta release.

## Individual Contributions
### ABRAHAM: 
### Last Week Goals:
- Connect our project to the server I decide on.

### Progress and Issues:
- Minimal things had been set up last week so it was tricky connecting the database, however after doing research I think connecting the database now won’t be so bad. YouTube has been a big help in this.
- Have been working on the CI files a lot as well, making sure the right credentials are connected so we can connect our unity game to the system. Been watching a lot of tutorials on Youtube to make sure we’re on the right track. 

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Finish up the database connection
- Finish up CI connection issues
- Write scripts that’ll send data back and forth from the server and the database.

### AZUCENA: 
### Last Week Goals:
- I started looking into how to connect a server to our mobile game on Unity and how getting a server on Azure works.

### Progress and Issues:
- I started looking into YouTube videos of connecting servers to mobile games in Unity. I started downloading everything that will be needed for server side. What I still need clarification on is if we will have to get a server from Azure or if we will just need Azure for the database. This is something I am still looking into. 

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Create a server connection on the C# file. Test it on a small game on Unity so when the front-end is done implementing their part we can easily connect everything. Also if there are any bugs or issues I could work on those bugs while front-end is still being implemented.

### NATHAN:
### Last Week Goals: 
- I plan on going further into the aspect of how we're going to implement the design based on the game logic we plan to finalize on. (1 meeting)
- From then on make multiple prototypes of design that we can decide looks best as a group. (2 days)

### Progress and Issues:
- The progress I made was being able to create prototypes on krita that we/I could look at for inspiration when it comes to setting up our scene in Unity in how our game would look like in the 3d version. 
- Also learned how to use krita and create on Unity.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- I plan on creating my own branch of our main repo so i can create some version of what we want our scene to look like and what assets we want to be asserted in our game(2 days)
- From then on come together with the front end and decide what parts of our each branches we like to push to the main to so we can create our demo for the Demo presentation(1 day) 


--------------
### HINAL:
### Last Week Goals:
- This week I started to design the 3D objects and started to set up the screen in unity.

### Progress and Issues:
- I am having issues or steeper learning curve with attaching the 3D objects with other 3D objects in unity. My plan is to research more and learn more about how to fix this.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Next week I plan to finish all the 3D objects in the unity and give it to tian for writing scripts.  



---------------------
### TIAN:
### Last Week Goals:
- Work on designing the basic testing & CI of our project
  - Unity project testing isn’t familiar to me, spend some time to get more informed on that
  - Work on CI with teammates
- Get a better understanding on how game development can be parallelized with teammates. This would likely involve a lot of meetings and learning as at least I don’t have much experience on that and what’s in front of me in terms of how this project will go is very vague.

### Progress and Issues:
- Worked on setting up CI
  - Set up an example CI for teammates to learn and build upon.
  - After teammates finished the basic GameCI setup, I spent some time testing it, and we ran into a number of issues with Unity license management, among other things. 
    - Fixed some CI failure cases including those caused by incorrect project structure required to be properly checked out by CI, but more work remains to be done.
    - I forwarded the issue to Abraham because he owns the repo and has admin access to it, which is required for managing licenses and such.
- Discussed the game's design with the team and are now developing a 3D game rather than a 2D one. This is due to a variety of factors, including labor challenges when creating animations, game play logic, and a poor representation of making a baseball game in 2D.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Communicate with Abraham regarding CI setup progress
  
- Start implementing some core classes that're required by the game including batting logic, etc. Work with the rest of the front-end team to integrate assets and gameplay.
