## Development Process
### Software Toolset
- Unity with C#: Central to game development, handling both front-end and core game mechanics.
- Android Studio: For additional Android-specific features and testing.
- Java and Python: For backend services, including server logic and web services.
- Database: For real-time data management  and syncing.
- Unity APIs and Google Play Services: For integrating in-app purchases, leaderboards, and Android functionalities.
- Third-Party SDKs: For ads, analytics, and social media features.


## Risks
- Unity Learning Curve: The team has limited Unity experience, presenting a high impact risk due to Unity's complexity. 
- Google Play Store Compliance: Adhering to Google Play Store guidelines is a risk because the team lacks app deployment experience. 
- Krita-Unity Integration: Integrating Krita animations into Unity poses a high impact risk due to unfamiliarity with both tools. 



## Requirements
### Non-functional Requirements
- Low loading time ensuring gaming experience that can take place in anytime, anywhere.
- The game should run at 60 FPS for a smooth experience.
- Design for minimal and efficient user interactions.


### External Requirements
- Robust error handling.
- Easy installation and play.

## Repo Layout
- Divided by front and back end work.
    - Within the front and backend, different components will have their own sub directories for modularity.
       - For example, data management and the framework components will each have their own sub directories within the backend directory.


We look forward to developing an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience with Home Run. For more information or to contribute to the project, please refer to the Git repository linked above.
