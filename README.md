- MySQL: Data management.
- C++ with Unreal Engine: Frontend development.
- iMessage Integration Tools: Xcode, Messages Framework, MSConversation, MSMessage, iMessage API.

## Risks
- Limited access to MacOS for iOS development.
- Complexity in integrating frontend and backend.
- Challenges in hosting the game on GamePigeon.


## Requirements
### Non-functional Requirements
- Secure, private sessions between players.
- iOS-themed simplicity in design and interactions.
- Efficient user interactions with minimal in-game controls.

### External Requirements
- Robust error handling.
- Smooth integration with GamePigeon.

## Repo Layout
- Divided by front and back end work
    - Within the front and back, different components will have their own sub directories for modularity


We look forward to developing an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience with Home Run. For more information or to contribute to the project, please refer to the Git repository linked above.
