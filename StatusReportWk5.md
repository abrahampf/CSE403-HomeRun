# Weekly Status Report

## Team Report

### Last Week Goals:
Do individual research and learning into how each of our components works to get started on implementation.

### Progress and Issues:
We have been watching tutorials/ doing research on our own components. Getting familiar with our environment. Not stuck on any one piece just trying to beat the learning curve in time to successfully use our toolset. 

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
#### Begin implementation:
- Animation renderings theme/ rough art style solidification
  - 3 days
- Solidify rules/game mechanics
  - 1 day
- Begin script writing/ rough draft
  - 2 days
- Connect database to our project
  - 2 days
- Find a server to host our game on
  - 2 days
 
------------------------------------------------
## Individual Contributions
### ABRAHAM: 
### Last Week Goals:
Look into databases and how they can be implemented into our game smoothly.

### Progress and Issues:
I’ve found a list of databases that could work, mostly working on deciding on 

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Connect our project to the server I decide on. 



------------
### AZUCENA: 
### Last Week Goals:
Figuring out if we are going to build an IOS game or Android. Getting an idea of how different parts of the project would be connected. Also looked into which servers we could host the game on.

### Progress and Issues:
When doing the Architecture and design assignment I got clarity on which servers would be beneficial for us to host on. We would have to decide on the server as a team so everyone is aware of that. 

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Look into how the server would be connected to the database and front end. Start to implement a small outline of the backend code.



-------------
### NATHAN:
### Last Week Goals: 
Decide between if we were going to stick through our original plans of having an ios compatible game that we can implement or do a little tweaking to our Paper document and shift our project to something that we can actually complete with the resources available to us.
Also watch tutorials on Frigma that will be used when Prototyping our design for the game and how the main features will loom. 

### Progress and Issues:
The progress made was that deciding since reservation will be needed to acquire the equipments we need to finish out our project, made the quick shift to do an android based project. I was able to do a side by side tutorial for Frigma so I can learn the basics but the only issue is most tutorials were based on web design so I have to make sure to find one that deals with game design.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
For next week:
- I plan on going further into the aspect of how we're going to implement the design based on the game logic we plan to finalize on. (1 meeting)
-  From then on make multiple prototypes of design that we can decide looks best as a group.(2 days)



--------------
### HINAL:
### Last Week Goals:
Think about and finalize about which platform to use IOS vs android since we didn’t have access to MAC. Then also finalize which platforms to use and how to implement frontend and backend architectures.

### Progress and Issues:
We have decided which platform to use and I have started to make initial prototypes for our game. I have also started to learn how to use unity for our game development.

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
Next week I plan to finish paper prototyping and also figma prototyping and get feedback from my group members and TA’s to ensure that the design looks good. 



---------------------
### TIAN:
### Last Week Goals:
- Think about and finalize the decision with the team on what platform and in what form our product shall be. I suspect that our original plan would not work due to the following reasons:
  - iOS dev for our team would be extremely difficult due to the lack of macOS devices
  - GamePigeon doesn't disclose it's API or any other ways for outside developers to make games
- Revise documents to reflect the changes to our plan if it happens.

### Progress and Issues:
- Discussed with the team and decided that we are transitioning to making a single-player focused Android baseball game to accommodate difficulties in iOS dev and GamePigeon issues.
  - We are still deciding on in what forms specifically this game should take on. 
  - Currently, it seems like we have some consensus that the game should still be turn-based, but real-time playing against AI. 
  - We currently plan on only including the pitching & batting features, like the iOS version design.
- Worked on architecture & design doc
  - Completed my part for certain sections of the doc
  - Revised some of the doc to accommodate for the changes we made

### Outline/Plans for Upcoming Week:
- Work on designing the basic testing & CI of our project
  - Unity project testing isn’t familiar to me, spend some time to get more informed on that
  - Work on CI with teammates
- Get a better understanding on how game development can be parallelized with teammates. This would likely involve a lot of meetings and learning as at least I don’t have much experience on that and what’s in front of me in terms of how this project will go is very vague.
